# SwiftUI Airtable Demo

This is a small, functional example app that demonstrates how you can use Airtable as a lightweight backend. I wouldn't recommend using Airtable to store fast-moving data but as a means of storing strings, images, positions of views, and general data that won't get updated very often, Airtable could be a potential option for you.

## Running the app

1. Clone the repo and open the `.xcworkspace` file (You shouldn't need to run `pod install`).
2. Create your own Airtables and mimick the same column types and data as I have in the screenshots above.
3. **Important**: Visit https://airtable.com/api, choose your Base, and get the link to your base and API key. Plug those into `apiKey` and `apiBaseUrl` in [`AirtableService.swift`](https://github.com/zackshapiro/SwiftUIAirtableDemo/blob/master/SwiftUIAirtableDemo/Services/AirtableService.swift#L14).
4. Build and run the app.
